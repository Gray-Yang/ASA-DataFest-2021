5. Describe the analysis  
To determine the severity of substance abuse, we looked at the percentage of respondents who had used a substance and the rate of misuse of that substance by those individuals. We then used regression models to identify factors that might have a significant impact on substance abuse propensity.  

6. Insight the conclusion  
We found in our survey that codeine is the most misused of all prescription drugs. This abuse occurred mainly in the Quebec region, where 33.21 percent of residents without mental illness abused codeine. Students across Canada use marijuana, which is the most used illegal drug, significantly more than non-students. The high use of cannabis among Canadian students may require caution. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the use of cannabis by students in order to understand the potential for drug abuse
